# Industrial Human Resource Geo-Visualization

## Overview
This project focuses on geo-visualizing the distribution and analysis of industrial human resources across various regions. The classification of main workers and marginal workers, other than cultivators and agricultural laborers, by sex and by section, division, and class, has been traditionally used to understand the economic status and employment trends in the country. Additionally, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to analyze textual data from job postings, industry reports, and social media to gain further insights into the labor market.

## Features
- **Workforce Distribution Maps**: Visualize the concentration of workforce in different industries by region.
- **Skill and Education Analysis**: Identify regions with high demand for certain skills and training needs.
- **Industry Growth Visualization**: Analyze trends in industrial growth and the impact of economic policies on employment.
- **NLP Analysis**: Extract insights from job postings, industry reports, and social media using NLP techniques.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Explore data through interactive maps and dashboards.
